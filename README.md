# NLP-model-for-a-Hotel-reviews-Dataset-

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) model is developed for a hotel reviews dataset. Each row of this dataset represents one review about a hotel. The first column is the text of the review and the second column is the rating that the person gave to the hotel. Ratings are between 1 to 5. There are 20491 observations. Data prepration, bag of words model, and some classification models are used in this project. 

After preparing the data and building the bag of words model, these classification models are developed in order to have a model that can predict the rating of a review : Naive Bayes, Logistics Regression, K-nn model, and Random Forest model.

Confusion matrix and accuracy score are used to compare the classification models and find the one with the best performance. Based on these metrics, Logistic Regression has the best performance. It can predict the rating based on someones's review with 58% accuracy.
